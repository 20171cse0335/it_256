After the release of the 2009 film Magadheera, which was only his second film, directed by S.S.Rajamouli, Charan established himself as one of the leading contemporary actors of Tollywood. He played dual roles in this film in which one is a brave soldier of a kingdom in Rajasthan in the 17th century in love with the princess but loses her and dies, the other a bike racer who falls in love with a girl who is the re-incarnation of the princess and wins her knowing their past.

Both his characters were done justice and he reminded of his father at many places."[12] Directed by S. S.

His next film was Rachcha, directed by Sampath Nandi. He did the role of Betting Raj, a gambler whose life takes a toll on him. IndiaGlitz wrote: "He shows flashes of Chiru-ness more than he ever did in the past; be it his baritone or demeanour, he is a Megastar in effect.

His first release in 2013 was Naayak, directed by V. V. Vinayak. He played another dual role, one a mafia leader in Kolkata and the other a simple software employee in Hyderabad.

Bangalore Mirror wrote: "For Ram Charan, Yevadu is essential to establish his status after Thoofan tanked at the box office. His character has two shades and he tries his best to bring variations. He dances like there is no tomorrow and the choreography is a delight to watch."[21] Sify wrote: "Compared to his earlier films – Nayak and Thoofan, Ram Charan has done a fairly good job here. His acting is effective in intense scenes and action episode. To satisfy his audiences, he has also done some good steps in the Freedom song."[22] Charan's next release in the same year was the family drama Govindudu Andarivadele.[23] The film opened to mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed over ₹40 crore (US$5.6 million) at the box office.[24]

His next film was Bruce Lee[25] where he played the role of a stuntman who gets involved in a scuffle. It wasn't a success due to its weak narration and comedy.[26] His next film Dhruva (2016) was declared a hit due its unique story and visuals. Times of India wrote: "Ram

Charan looks his fittest best. As an actor, Ram Charan impresses in all the scenes that required high emotion. And as for the scenes where he had to be elevated as the hero, they will not disappoint his fans."[27] In 2018, he acted in the blockbuster Rangasthalam directed by Sukumar, declared as third highest grosser of all time in Telugu cinema.[28] In 2019, he starred alongside Kiara Advani and Vivek Oberoi in an action film Vinaya Vidheya Rama which was directed by Boyapati Srinu.[citation needed]
